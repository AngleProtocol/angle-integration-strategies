# Angle Integration Strategies

## Introduction

This repository contains strategies for integrators to use to let their users deposit into the Angle Protocol while taking a performance fee on the accrued yield. The strategies can be any DeFi product that has a yield, such as staking, lending, farming, etc.

## BaseStrategy

It is an abstract contract that inherits the ERC4626 interface and that is meant to be a proxy of an underlying strategy contract. This means that instead of depositing in the underlying strategy, users will deposit in the proxy and gain the same yield as if they had deposited in the underlying strategy. The proxy will then deposit the funds in the underlying strategy.

Extra features in this contract includes the ability to take a performance fee on the yield generated by the underlying strategy (split with developperFee which takes a portion of the performance fee), the ability to swap tokens and vest linearly external rewards for a period of time.

It has hooks that needs to be implemented to create a strategy:
- `_beforeWithdraw` is called before the user withdraws their funds. It can be used to withdraw from the strategy if needed.
- `_afterDeposit` is called after the user deposits their funds. It can be used to deposit in the strategy if needed.
- `_assetsHeld` is called to get the amount of assets held by the strategy.

And ERC4626 view functions that needs to be implemented:
- `maxDeposit` is called to get the maximum amount of tokens that can be deposited in the strategy.
- `maxWithdraw` is called to get the maximum amount of tokens that can be withdrawn from the strategy.
- `maxMint` is called to get the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted by the strategy.
- `maxRedeem` is called to get the maximum amount of tokens that can be redeemed by the strategy.

A keeper needs to be created to accrue fees if there hasn't been any deposit or withdrawal for a certain period of time. The keeper needs to also harvest external rewards and swap tokens if needed.

## ERC4626Strategy

It is an contract that inherits the BaseStrategy contract and implements the hooks needed to create a strategy for an underlying 4626 strategy.

One of the limitation of the contract is that the underlying strategy needs to have infinite minting such as stUSD or metamorpho.

## Role Recaps

There are three roles in the contract:
- `KEEPER_ROLE`: The role that can swap tokens and vest rewards.
- `DEVELOPER_ROLE`: The role that can set developer fees, developer fee recipient, vesting period and swap parameters (swap router and transfer token address).
- `INTEGRATOR_ROLE`: The role that can set integrator fees, integrator fee recipient.

The Integrator role is its own admin meaning that the initial integrator can add a new integrator and remove themselves from the role.
The Developer role is its own admin meaning that the initial developer can add a new developer and remove themselves from the role.
The Keeper role has developer role as admin meaning that the initial developer can add a new keeper and remove initialKeeper from the role. (It is designed as such because the developer is the one that should be operating the keeper).
